### No Prerequisites, Installation, or Testing Instructions required

## Misc Notes

* Instructions conflicted with demo video as to whether to prepopulate page with array/buttons, so went with Instructions.  
* Among the UI enhancements beyond [giftastic demo](http://ucb.bootcampcontent.com/UCB-Coding-Bootcamp/09-11-2017-UCB-Class-Repository-FSF-FT/raw/master/03-week/homework/part-2/Instructions/homework_demo.mov):
  * Check whether new search term/button already exists (with error message).
  * Added label for current search term GIFs. 
* Feedback appreciated.
